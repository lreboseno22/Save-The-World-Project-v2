                <p class="text">Although fertilizer may be good on crops, when it ends up in the ocean, it can cause harm.<br>Excess nitrogen from fertilizer causes algae blooms; the overgrowth of algae.<br><br>The mass amounts of alfae building up block sunlight from penetrating through the water's surface and the decaying of such large amounts of algae consume oxygen so oxygen levels would drop in that area. This process is called <u>eutrophication</u> and it causes "dead zones" which are areas where oxygen levels are so low it can't hold any life. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/climate/nitrogen-fertilizers-climate-change-pollution-waterways-global-warming.html">(5)</a></p>

This means they lose their food source causing them to turn a white pale color.<a href="https://envirobites.org/2018/03/22/are-harmful-algal-blooms-a-new-concern-for-coral-reefs/">(6)</a></p> <br>

            <p class="text">Coral reefs offer shelter and protection from storms and waves. They also provide habitats for other orgnisms. Coral reefs also produce calium carbonate which makes up the coral's skeleton as well as other organisms shells and skeleton.<br><br>Other organisms like the parrotfish rely on coral as their food source, other organisms rely on coral as a home or protection from larger predators.<br><br>Taking away coral will result in organisms not having a food source and others being left without a habitat to have their young and being more vulerable to predators in addition to this other organisms won't be able to create their shells and skeletons. All of which would ultimately result in these creatures dying and throwing off the food web.<a href="https://telanganatoday.com/what-will-happen-if-all-coral-reefs-die#:~:text=The%20disappearance%20of%20coral%20reefs,source%20of%20food%20disappears%20forever.&text=Climate%20change%20and%20bleached%20coral,will%20lead%20to%20job%20losses.">(7)</a></p><br> <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/11/1e/c3/111ec33c24cee994c9fb5be4dbb8b8bb.jpg" class="pic2"></div>

                        <li class="text">Use organic fertilizer or compost</li>

                            <li class="text">Use fertilizers appropiately and manage them wisely</li>
                            <li class="text">Avoid using fertilizer when you know there will be heavy rainfall the next day</li>
                            <li class="text">Improve feild / soil conditions that promote growth of crops naturally (without the use of fertilizer)</li>
